# OFT Bridge UI (Next.js + React + Material UI)

The OFT Bridge UI project is an interface designed for bridging Omnichain Fungible Tokens (OFT) across different blockchains using the LayerZero protocol (https://layerzero.network/). The Omnichain Fungible Token (OFT) Standard enables the transfer of fungible tokens across multiple blockchains without the need for asset wrapping, middlechains, or liquidity pools.
